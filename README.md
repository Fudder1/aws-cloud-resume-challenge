# AWS Cloud Resume Challenge
This is my attempt at cloud resume challenge in AWS.

What is Cloud Resume Challenge? - [The Cloud Resume Challenge](https://cloudresumechallenge.dev/) is a multiple-step resume project which helps build and demonstrate skills fundamental to pursuing a career in Cloud. 

The resume website is built with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript and hosted using AWS loud services. It is deployed using CloudFront, S3 and Route 53. Resources are managed using  Identity and Access Management (IAM) and Certificate Manager. JavaScript is used to call a Lambda function to display a live visitor counter, which updates in Dynamo DB. Uses Github Actions for CI/CD to automatically deploy changes to AWS. Implemented IAC using Terraform to deploy the Lambda function.
